<h1>Building a BMI Calculator with Python</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project involved building an interactive BMI calculator in Python that collects a user’s name, weight, and height through input prompts, converts those values into numerical types, and applies the standard BMI formula to generate an accurate result. The script then uses conditional logic to classify the BMI into medically recognized categories (such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or severely obese)and returns a personalized message to the user. Additional features include basic error checking, clean variable handling, and customized user feedback, demonstrating foundational Python skills in input handling, mathematical operations, type conversion, control flow, and console-based user interaction.
